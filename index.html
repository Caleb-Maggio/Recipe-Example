            <h4><b><em>You're going to need to get many different types of unrefined food, so you

                store, or you could steal them from your neighbor.</em></b></h4>

            <h3>Part II: Make The Food</h3>
            <h4><b><em>Now that you've acquired the unfinished food, you can now finish the food.
            </em></b></h4>
            <h5>This recipe will make a dish for 4, or 1 if you're really, really hungry.</h5>

            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-greek">
                <li>Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of cling film to set its 
                    shape, then chill overnight.</li>
                <li>Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a hot pan with 
                    a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until browned all over and rare in the 
                    middle. Remove from the pan and leave to cool.</li>
                <li>Finely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the 
                    thyme leaves and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their 
                    juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes until all the 
                    excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom paste (known 
                    as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool. 
                    <b>IMPORTANT: WHATEVER YOU DO, DO <em>NOT</em> ADD ORANGE JUICE.</b></li>
                <li>Cut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each 
                    piece into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets. Chill 
                    in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li>Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma 
                    ham in the middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a square. Spread half 
                    the duxelle evenly over the ham.</li>
                <li>Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. 
                    Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the 
                    cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other 
                    beef fillet, then chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Put the seasoned beef fillets on a clothesline outside your house, and let
                    them dry for 3-5 business days. Make sure when you remove them from the line,
                    you let them fall onto the ground so they can be marinated with topsoil.</li>
                <li>Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then 
                    wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all 
                    over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the red wine sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan, then fry the 
                    beef trimmings for a few minutes until browned on all sides. Stir in the shallots 
                    with the peppercorns, bay and thyme and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, 
                    stirring frequently, until the shallots turn golden brown.</li>
                <li><em>*sigh....*</em> You burnt the beef. You have to be kidding me. Perfect. Just
                perfect.</li>
                <li>No, no it's fine. It's OK, we all make mistakes. It's just... this was supposed
                    to be a special meal. I picked out these ingredients really carefully, and
                    they <em>really</em> weren't cheap...</li>
                <li>No! You't can't <em>uncook</em> meat, that's not how it works! It's ruined!</li>
                <li>You know what? Just forget it. I'm just going to order McDonald's. Screw it.</li>
